- Direction arrow added in the navigate tab.
- Fixed: Couldn't restore the objects original name after it was renamed at least once.
- Fixed: If the location simulation was enabled and the simulated point was a GPS point
  then its name was overwritten with its closest address on route calculation.
- Fixed: If your device doesn't support speech input you couldn't navigate to an address from the
  main menu. Now you can enter the address manually instead.
- Smaller bug fixes and ui improvements
