WalkersGuide is a navigational aid primarily intended for blind and visual impaired pedestrians. It
calculates routes and shows nearby points of interest.  The project consists of an Android app
and a server. The latter performs the route calculation.

The map data is provided by OpenStreetMap, a project to create a free map of the world.

Main app features:
- Calculate routes optimized for blind and visually impaired users
- Explore layout of intersections
- Show and track nearby POI
- Simulate any street address
- Import GPX files
- Record your own routes

The application is fully accessible with Android's screen reader Talkback.
