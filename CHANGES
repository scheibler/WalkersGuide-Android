------------------

  was a GPS point, then its name was overwritten with its closest
  address on route calculation.

  main menu. Now you can enter the address manually instead.

------------------

New entries in the redesigned apps main menu:

- A message queue has been implemented to prevent navigation instruction interruptions (#6).
- Announcements now include bearing updates to the next route point, in addition to continuous distance updates while navigating.
- Fixed a bug where Talkback would take precedence over the distance and bearing announcements from the app's TTS, frequently interrupting them (#5).

Routes:
- New presets for way class weights. Makes it easier to calculate routes for
  different use cases like hiking or walking in urban areas.
- GPX file export added
- Current coordinates are now automatically resolved to their closest address when used as the starting point for route calculation.
- Fixed: Route calculation previously failed if one or more via points were included.

Additional user interface changes:
- New talkback actions for the bearing and location buttons in the toolbar
    - Bearing: Switch between values from compass or satellite, Enable/disable simulation
    - Location: Speak current address, Show GPS details, Enable/disable simulation

- More detailed information for pedestrian crossings
- New settings:
    - Prefer localized names and descriptions from the OpenStreetMap if available.
